# Flight Spy - flight tracker app 
👋 Hi, 

✈️ I would like to present to you my new SwiftUI app with MVVM pattern. It's Flight Spy, flight tracker application. To get the aircrafts I used free api: https://opensky-network.org. To get more info about the flight I created REST api in PHP.

🟥 Here is a link to the youtube video, that shows how the app looks like: https://youtu.be/ctARyKBTel4

👉 To create logo I used ChatGPT DALL-E.

👉 Flags of the countries are downloaded from: https://www.flagi-panstw.pl.

👉 For icons and pins I used SF Symbols and a few of them are downloaded from https://www.flaticon.com.

🔥 A few interesting features that are implemented to the app:

◻️ Slide in tab with image of the aircraft, informations about the flight and menu at the bottom with buttons to show some extra informations about the flight and path of the flight.

▫️ To get data about the flight I created REST api in PHP, that scrapes informations from: https://radarbox.com.

◻️ Button, with an action of finding user current location. If the location is on regions list, it automatically starts showing aircrafts in the region.
