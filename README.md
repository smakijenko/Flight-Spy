# Flight Spy - flight tracker app 
Hi, 

I present to you my new SwiftUI app. It's Flight Spy, flight tracker application.

Here is a link to the youtube video, that shows how the app looks like: https://youtu.be/ctARyKBTel4

► To create logo I used ChatGPT DALL-E.
► Flags of the countries are downloaded from: https://www.flagi-panstw.pl.
► For icons and pins I used SF Symbols or I downloaded them from https://www.flaticon.com.

A few interesting features that are implemented to the app:

▪️ As I named it - Pulsator. It it an aircraft position refresh indicator. On tap, it shows intervals drop down menu.

▪️ Button, with an action of finding user current location. If the location is on regions list, it automatically starts showing aircrafts in the region.
